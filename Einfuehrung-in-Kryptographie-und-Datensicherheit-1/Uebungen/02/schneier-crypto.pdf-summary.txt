With cryptography, what you see isn’t what you get. Subtle flaws can render any security system vulnerable to attack. Counterpane Systems has the expertise you need to make sure your system is as secure as it looks.

COUNTERPANE SYSTEMS

WHY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS
################################ ACRONYMS ###########################
################################ QUESTIONS ##########################
What motivates the attackers?
Must attacks be prevented, or can they just be detected?
If the worst happens and one of the fundamental security assumptions of a system is broken, what kind of disaster recovery is possible?
Are the audit logs good enough to convince a court of law?
############################### FIGURES #############################
But we can work toward 100% risk acceptance
############################### PROGNOSES #############################
And in the future, as commerce and communications continue to move to computer networks, cryptography will become more and more vital
But when these products are widely used, they will become tempting targets for criminals
The press will publicize the attacks, undermining public confidence in these systems
Ultimately, products will win or lose in the marketplace depending on the strength of their security
Electronic commerce schemes will also face fraud, through forgery, misrepresentation, denial of service, and cheating
A computer encryption program, no matter how good, will not prevent an attacker from going through someone’s garbage
No amount of general beta testing will reveal a security flaw, and there’s no test possible that can prove the absence of flaws
The threat model must take the entire system into account—not just the data to be protected, but the people who will use the system and how they will use it
Just because a protocol is logically secure doesn’t mean it will stay secure when a designer starts defining message structures and passing bits around
It’s hard to convince consumers that their financial privacy is important when they are willing to leave a detailed purchase record in exchange for one thousandth of a free trip to Hawaii
History has taught us: never underestimate the amount of money, time, and effort someone will expend to thwart a security system
Assume science and technology will soon be able to do things they cannot yet
